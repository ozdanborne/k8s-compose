# Docker-Compose a Kubernetes Cluster

An easy to use kubernetes clulster for tinkering with API calls.

etcd and k8s-apiserver default ports are port-forwarded to the host,
allowing use of calicoctl and kubectl with near-zero configuration.

### Requirements

- docker
- docker-compose

### Running

```
docker-compose up -d
```
